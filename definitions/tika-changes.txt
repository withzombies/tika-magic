Updated the `application/x-tika-ooxml` rule to detect more valid cases by introducing a search range.

Updated the `text/x-uuencode` rule to detect uu encoded data.

Updated the `audio/mp4` rule to be a direct descendant of `video/quicktime` instead of a second-level descendant. This is to
avoid situations where the ftyp rule matches for quicktime but not for `video/mp4`.

Combined `model/vnd.gs-gdl` and `model/vnd.gs.gdl` by marking `model/vnd.gs.gdl` as an alias of `model/vnd.gs-gdl`.

Swapped the definitions of `text/x-c` and `text/x-csrc`, because some classes declare themselves as subclasses of `text/c-x`
and not `text/x-csrc`.

Updated the `video/mp4` rule to include more ftyps from https://ftyps.com.

I also have two changes to better support my personal project's constraints, which I hope are acceptable:
* Updated the `text/x-matlab` rules to be more specific, so they're less likely to conflict with PDF rules.
* Bumped the "%PDF-" rule priority to 70.
